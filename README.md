# GoShape
GoShape is my university project from Computer Graphics.

It's goal is to explore the ways colors can be represented and how can it be mapped to the color displayed on monitor. Especially in the context of XYZ color model. The bottom part of the graph is interactive - click on it to modify the the amount of light in each frequency, and see, how it maps to the color in XYZ-cove model.

Written in pure go. To run, you need to have go 1.15+ installed:
```
go run .
```
